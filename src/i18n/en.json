Maintaining a moderate level of energy, known as the \"green level\", is optimal for any mental or physical activity \n\n It's important to note that higher energy levels indicate a higher activation of the sympathetic nervous system and metabolic processes. If the sympathetic drive is chronically too high, it can lead to harmful stress reactions. \n\n Knowing when to speed up and slow down is crucial for feeling and performing well and achieving personal goals.

Our first idea was to create an app that tracks body weight directly from wearable devices. We developed the Body Mass app for Apple Watch, making bodyweight tracking easy and automatically recording measurements in Apple Health. The clean and minimalistic design of the app has made it very popular.",
        "P5": "One of our latest apps, Emotion, aims to promote mental wellness by providing a fast and easy personality test. In addition to physical wellness and health tracking, we have created our first app, Emotion, to promote mental wellness.
