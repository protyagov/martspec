      "CONTENT": "People with a high energy level are active, lively, and full of enthusiasm. They are sociable, competitive, cheerful, and open. They feel comfortable interacting with strangers, visiting new places, and starting new activities. People with a low energy level are quieter, more reserved, and withdrawn. They tend to conserve energy, accumulate strength, and have an attitude focused on minimizing effort and avoiding active engagement.\n\n>Energy can refer to a person's level of enthusiasm and vitality. Although it is not traditionally considered a distinct personality trait, a person's energy level can greatly influence their behavior, interactions, and overall approach to life.\n\nIt is important to note that a higher energy level indicates greater activation of the sympathetic nervous system and metabolic processes. However, if this level remains too high for an extended period, it may lead to harmful stress reactions.",

       "CONTENT": "An energetic person demonstrates unique traits that influence their lifestyle and interactions with the world around them. Such a person is characterized by vitality, sociability, and adaptability. These traits help them live a fulfilling life, achieve success in various fields, and build meaningful relationships with others. \n\n- **Vitality** — distinguishes a person through their high level of energy and activity. It manifests in their drive to achieve goals and complete tasks. An energetic person is full of enthusiasm, passion, and determination to overcome challenges. Thanks to this trait, they can turn every challenge into a new opportunity for growth and development. People with high vitality are often easy to recognize at work through their physical energy, attentiveness, and excitement. They enjoy change and variety and actively seek situations that provide these. Those with lower vitality tend to be calmer, slower-paced, and more deliberate in their actions. Some may perceive them as lacking motivation or enthusiasm, but that is not necessarily true—they simply don’t express their excitement as visibly and prefer not to be the center of attention. \n\n- **Sociability** — is another remarkable quality of an energetic person. Such people gravitate toward communication and find joy and inspiration in connecting with others. They easily make new acquaintances, actively participate in group events, and are not afraid to speak in public. Their sociability helps them build strong relationships, create supportive networks, and access new opportunities. People with high sociability are the “social butterflies” of any company, known across departments. They enjoy being involved in what’s happening around them and quickly establish connections, making them invaluable team members. Those with lower sociability are more reserved and private. They take longer to integrate into new teams and may feel less comfortable in social situations. Others may need more time to get to know them, and they often have fewer but deeper relationships. \n\n- **Adaptability.** People with high adaptability are curious and open-minded. They can easily adjust to new situations and respond quickly to changes in their environment. This allows them to solve problems effectively and adapt swiftly to new demands and challenges. When faced with difficulties, they like hearing others’ opinions and find group idea exchange inspiring. On the other hand, people with lower adaptability prefer to work on problems independently and present their conclusions after careful thought and consideration.",
