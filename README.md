## Images WebP

We use **webp** format for non SVG images on the site. When we get new images from designer do this:

1. Copy PNG images to an empty _/src/img/new_ folder.

2. Run script _/src/img/img.sh_:
    - open the Git Bash terminal
    - run `./src/img/img.sh`
3. Delete images from the _/src/img/new_ folder after checking the resulting images.

This will create .webp images in _/src/img_ folder whose max size would be 512px.

#### Script settings 🛠️:
-   `DIR_INPUT` - the source directory with the images to convert (relative to the script folder). Default value `new` for _/src/img/new_ folder.

-   `DIR_OUT` - the output directory with the resulting images (relative to the script folder). Default empty value for _/src/img_ folder.

-   `MAX_SIZE` - maximum size in px for the image height and width. Default value: `512`.

#### In order to run the script you need to install the following aps:
-   [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) - WebP encoder tool to compress an image file to a WebP file

-   [pngcrush](https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush/) - an optimizer for PNG files

-   for non-macOS operating systems:

    - [magick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) - command line tool from ImageMagick
    > on macOS the script uses [sips](https://ss64.com/mac/sips.html) - the macOS command line tool
