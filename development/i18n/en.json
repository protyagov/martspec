        "A2": "Mild anxiety may arise in response to small stresses in our lives, but it should not last long and does not prevent us from functioning. This is a common feeling that can be overcome.",
        "A3": "Emotional tension is a feeling of internal pressure, nervousness and perhaps even anger. This feeling can arise in response to stressors that we experience every so often in our lives. Try focusing on your breathing and doing relaxation exercises to reduce your stress levels.",
        "A4": "This state can occur when we are faced with new or unexpected events in life. It finds expression in behavior that is not typical for you in your usual environment. For example, at home you can behave completely normally: communicate with relatives and neighbors, take care of your parents, keep the apartment clean, show respect for family values. At work, you change dramatically: you cannot establish contact with colleagues or superiors, you are rude to others or withdrawn, you come late for work or smoke in the wrong place. \n\n There may be an impact on your psychophysical state as well. If at home you are peaceful and feel great, then at work the level of anxiety can rise sharply, breathing and heartbeat quicken, profuse sweating is observed.",
        "A5": "Panic anxiety can cause a loss of self-control and focus. It affects your physiological and psychological state. You might feel frozen, unable to control your own body, and even lashing out at others for seemingly no reason. You might experience an upset stomach, shallow breathing, shakiness, headache, eye strain, racing heartbeat, etc. \n\n Panic anxiety has also been known to override fundamental levels of self-preservation and decision-making skills. \n\n People often use the terms panic attack and panic anxiety interchangeably, but they are not the same. Panic anxiety builds gradually over time after a period of excessive worry, symptoms can vary in intensity and prevail for longer periods. \n\n WHAT MIGHT HELP: \n • Acknowledging the situation and remembering that symptoms will soon pass can reduce anxiety and fear. \n • Difficulty breathing is a common symptom at this stage. Learning breathing techniques can help. \n • Progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery can reduce anxiety. \n • Mindfulness helps people stay grounded in the present moment. It's helpful for people with anxiety, who worry about stressors.",

Based on your color selection we calculate your mental tension. If the tension is high, your strength is spent on maintaining mental integrity, combating personal problems, overcoming fatigue, etc. That leads to lower productivity. \n\n For example, working long under constant volitional tension; constant lack of opportunity for proper rest; as well as severe chronic diseases that deplete the body, - all cause a significant increase in mental tension and lower productivity. \n\n High mental tension manifests itself in limited social activity and regular cases of \"tiredness of everything\". No strength to even set new goals. Lack of confidence. The mood is dominated by an anxious expectation of trouble. Disappointment with the life course. Your brain redirects all energy to dampen problems and reconcile opposing motives. Your attention is routed to the tense inner world. \n\n When your productivity is low you better stop what you are doing and rest. There is no point in continuing with the current task because your productivity is not optimal.",
        "P1": "You are overly fatigued. Mental tension is quite high. Your attention is easily distracted by extraneous things. You are getting stuck on emotional experiences. An absence of well-defined motives makes you reactive and purposeless. The mood can fluctuate between excitement and depression in the shortest time possible. The whole emotional state is dominated by anxiety, a premonition of trouble, and a lack of desire to do anything. Your reaction and handling of an extreme situation is unreliable.",
        "P2": "Your potential is low while unproductive mental tension is high. You force yourself to do certain things. Constant self-control increases fatigue. Prolonged intensive work might cost you dearly in terms of health. That cost will be very unequal to what you will be able to accomplish. Emotionally you experience anxiety, increased excitability, and uncertainty.  In a stressful situation, disruption of activity and behavior is likely.",

In a familiar environment, you move from work to rest and back, from one type of activity to another without significant difficulties. If necessary, you are able to overcome fatigue by volitional effort. However, that leads to a long period of reduced efficiency and well-being.

Maintaining a moderate level of energy, known as the \"green level\", is optimal for any mental or physical activity \n\n It's important to note that higher energy levels indicate a higher activation of the sympathetic nervous system and metabolic processes. If the sympathetic drive is chronically too high, it can lead to harmful stress reactions. \n\n Knowing when to speed up and slow down is crucial for feeling and performing well and achieving personal goals. The sympathetic nervous system accelerates bodily functions, while the parasympathetic system slows them down.",

You need to allow yourself time to rest and recover.",

The clean and minimalistic design of the app has made it very popular.",
